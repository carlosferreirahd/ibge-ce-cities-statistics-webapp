# IBGE Cities Statistics

This project is a straightforward exploration of the Brazilian IBGE API, designed to help (us) understand how it works. It was originally created by my friend [Alcides](https://github.com/srcid) as a Python API that interacts with the IBGE API for a job challenge. I decided to build on his work by using his API to develop this simple yet functional React web app ðŸ˜„.

This web app lets you search for cities in the state of CearÃ¡ and view data such as population, literacy rates, and GDP trends over the years, as available from the IBGE API.
